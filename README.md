# Learning tools for the localization of mobile robots using visual landmarks in the environment and the extended Kalman filter

This proposal addresses the creation of educational tools that will help students with the concept of the location of a mobile robot using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) with landmarks placed on robot´s environment.


The localization of a robot is a fundamental tool for its navigation. There are localization methods based on different sources of information and hardware components, as there is no method that works properly in any scenario and for any robot. From the educational point of view, few students students are able to understand all the mathematical background involved in the localization process.



## Requirements
* Matlab 2020a (Required toolbox: Mobile Robotics Simulation Toolbox, Navigation Toolbox)

## Overview 

The proposed system is composed by the following main functions:

EKF (An excelent deviation of EKF can be foud in: THRUN, Sebastian; BURGARD, Wolfram; FOX, Dieter. Probalistic robotics. Kybernetes, 2006.)
* Predition step: Is generated by Probabilistic motion model defined in sampleOdometry.m  based on odometry readings.
* Update step: Is the way that EKF correct the robot pose by mesure landmarks.  (Faragher, Ramsey and cols.: Understanding the basis of the Kalman filter via a
simple and intuitive derivation. IEEE Signal processing magazine, 29(5):128–
132, 2012.)

Controlls

* Pure Pursuit Controller:For path tracking. (More information at https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/ug/pure-pursuit-controller.html)
* Field Histogram (VFH): For Obstacle and steerieag direction. (More information at https://www.mathworks.com/help/nav/ug/vector-field-histograms.html)
